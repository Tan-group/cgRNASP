# cgRNASP
cgRNASP: coarse-grained statistical potentials with residue separation for RNA structure evaluation.

We developed our residue-separation-based CG statistical potentials (cgRNASP) at several CG levels: 

(i) three CG beads at P, C4’, and N9 atoms for purine (or N1 atom for pyrimidine); 

(ii) two CG beads at P and C4’ atoms;

(iii) one CG bead on C4’ atom. 

Correspondingly, for simplicity, our CG statistical potentials are named as cgRNASP, cgRNASP-PC, and cgRNASP-C, respectively. The first potentials was named in such way since the potential of 3-bead representation was regarded as a representative one of the CG potentials.
